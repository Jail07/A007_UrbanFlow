Coursework Title:
Development of an Adaptive Traffic Light Control Algorithm Based on Transport Simulation


---

1. Introduction

With the rapid growth of urbanization and the increasing number of vehicles, traffic congestion has become a critical challenge for modern cities. Inefficient traffic light control leads to longer waiting times, higher fuel consumption, and increased environmental pollution.

Modern transport simulation technologies enable researchers and engineers to analyze traffic flows and design intelligent control systems without interfering with real-world road infrastructure. Simulation provides a safe and cost-effective environment for testing hypotheses and evaluating the effectiveness of traffic management strategies.

The purpose of this coursework is to develop an adaptive traffic light control algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness through transport simulation.

4. Methodology

The research will be conducted using a microscopic traffic simulation approach. A digital model of a selected urban district will be created using road network data imported from OpenStreetMap.

The simulation environment will be implemented in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), an open-source platform widely used for traffic research.

The study will follow these stages:

1. Importing and preparing the road network.


2. Generating realistic traffic demand scenarios, including peak-hour conditions.


3. Configuring fixed-time traffic signals to establish a baseline.


4. Collecting performance metrics such as:

average waiting time;

average travel time;

queue length;

traffic throughput.



5. Developing a rule-based adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts signal phases according to traffic conditions.


6. Running repeated simulations to ensure result consistency.


7. Performing a quantitative comparison between baseline and adaptive models.

5. Expected Results

The project is expected to demonstrate that adaptive traffic light control can significantly improve intersection performance. Anticipated outcomes include:

reduction in vehicle waiting time;

improved traffic flow stability;

decreased congestion levels;

potential reduction in vehicle emissions.


The results should confirm the effectiveness of simulation-based optimization for urban traffic management.

6. Practical Significance

The developed model may serve as a prototype for intelligent traffic control systems and can be further expanded using advanced techniques such as machine learning or real-time data integration.

Additionally, the project will strengthen practical competencies in transport modeling, algorithm design, and data-driven decision-making, which are essential skills for modern software and systems engineers.
